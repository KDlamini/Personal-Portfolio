					<p>Wilson was born on 3rd April 1992 in a small semi-urban town of Elangeni, in Swaziland (currently eSwatini). He grew up with imagination and ambition that at the time he could not really understand. His family in his perspective was just scrabbling for scarabs just to survive and he hated living just to survive. He was always fascinated by change and transformation, the idea of becoming great and doing better while everyone around him seemed satisfied with everything being the same. Thus in his way, he was quiet and reserved and often lost himself in his own imagination in hopes that he lived in society that noticed him with eager to manifest his potential.</p>
					<p>During his entire teenage-hood he refrained himself from all the petty little things that most teenagers were obsessed with. His goal was to get highly educated to use his knowledge to succeed from his state of feeling powerless and thus escaped a community that seemed to be going nowhere. Although it wasn’t easy but he managed to get excellent grades mostly in sciences. At the age of 19 he went to University of Pretoria to study Bcom (informatics) in pursuit of his dream to become financially free. His journey as a student didn’t quite go well, he had a mental breakdown and was forced to drop out.</p>
					<p>Although he had missed what seemed to be the only opportunity to succeed he was still optimistic about his future. He took a break for a few years embarking on a journey of self-discovery and world exploration until one day while on a failed attempt in meditating. He suddenly discovered his fascination with controlling machines. "The future is digital" he thought. He wanted to be a part of it in every possible way. In early 2018, he opted to dedicate himself to studying Web Development online. Web Development was an easy choice for him considering that he was already intrigued by design. In a few months he had completed <b>Html</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>SASS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>, as well as using <b>Bash</b> command line and <b>Git</b> repositories. He also managed to complete at least 9 projects as a junior front-end developer.</p>
					<p>His journey has just began. He is looking forward to learning more and soaring into great lengths to becoming a Full-stack developer as well branching into other areas of technology. With his positive mindset, ambition and dedication. There’s no one stopping him from achieving his goals.</p>
